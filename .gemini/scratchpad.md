# SpendWise Project - Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user requested to migrate the SpendWise project to GitHub. SpendWise is a personal expense tracker application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It includes features like budgets, savings goals, and ML-powered transaction categorization.

**Completed Actions:**

- ✅ Initialized Git repository locally
- ✅ Created initial commit with 31 project files
- ✅ Created public GitHub repository at https://github.com/sickn33/spendwise
- ✅ Pushed code to GitHub successfully
- ✅ Created walkthrough.md documentation

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **README Update Needed**: Current README contains only Vite template boilerplate, needs project-specific information
2. **Project Documentation**: Need to describe SpendWise features, installation, and usage
3. **CI/CD Setup** (optional): Could configure GitHub Actions for automated builds/deployments
4. **GitHub Pages** (optional): Could enable for live demo deployment
