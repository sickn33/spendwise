# SpendWise Project - Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user requested to migrate the SpendWise project to GitHub. SpendWise is a personal expense tracker application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It includes features like budgets, savings goals, and ML-powered transaction categorization.

**Completed Actions:**

- ✅ Initialized Git repository locally
- ✅ Created initial commit with 31 project files
- ✅ Created public GitHub repository at https://github.com/sickn33/spendwise
- ✅ Pushed code to GitHub successfully
- ✅ Created walkthrough.md documentation

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **README Update Needed**: Current README contains only Vite template boilerplate, needs project-specific information
2. **Project Documentation**: Need to describe SpendWise features, installation, and usage
3. **CI/CD Setup** (optional): Could configure GitHub Actions for automated builds/deployments
4. **GitHub Pages** (optional): Could enable for live demo deployment

## High-level Task Breakdown

- [x] Initialize Git and create repository on GitHub
- [x] Push initial codebase to GitHub
- [ ] Update README.md with SpendWise project information
- [ ] Add project badges (optional)
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
- [ ] Enable GitHub Pages deployment (optional, if requested)

**Success Criteria:**

- README.md contains clear project description, features, installation steps
- Repository is properly documented for public consumption
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub

## Project Status Board

### Current Sprint

- [/] Update README.md with SpendWise project details
- [ ] Add badges to README (build status, license, etc.)
- [ ] Consider GitHub Actions setup
- [ ] Consider GitHub Pages deployment

### Completed

- [x] Git repository initialization
- [x] GitHub repository creation
- [x] Initial code push
- [x] Walkthrough documentation

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Current Status**: Proceeding with README update to replace Vite template with SpendWise project information.

**Next Steps**: After README update, will commit and push changes, then ask user if they want CI/CD or deployment configuration.

## Lessons

- Repository successfully created with `gh repo create` command
- Using `--public --source=. --remote=origin --push` flags streamlines the setup process
- Always document migration work in walkthrough.md as per user rules
